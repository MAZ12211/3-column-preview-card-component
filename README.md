## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### What I learned

Using VARS in scss is incredible. Using more divs for grouping buttons and paragraphs. using the method that targets all IDs/classes in a single selector.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="boxes">
  <div class="box-1"></div>
  <div class="box-2"></div>
  <div class="box-3"></div>
</div>
```

```scss
.attribution a:hover {
   color: hsl(229, 21%, 39%); 
   transition: all 0.1s linear; 
   font-size: 15px;
 }
```

### Continued development

I should use VARS and media queries more as they were so helpful. I should make Divs for the nav and main and footer if I'm making a landing page
